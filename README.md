# Simulation-of-Tossing-a-Coin

**Question 1**

Simulate tossing a fair coin (a Bernoulli trial) 50 times. Count the number of heads. Record the longest run of heads. Generate a histogram for the Bernoulli outcomes.

**Question 1a**

Repeat the above experiment 20, 100, 200, and 1000 times. Generate a histogram for each showing the number of heads in 50 flips. Comment on the limit of the histogram.

**Quesiont 2**

Simulate tossing a biased coin 200 times where ܲሾHEADሿ ൌ 0.80. Count the number of heads. Record the longest run of heads. Generate a histogram for the Bernoulli outcomes.

**Quesiont 3**

Simulate tossing a fair coin 100 times. Generate a histogram showing the heads run length.

**Quesiont 4**

Simulate tossing a fair coin and count the number of tosses until reaching a user‐specified positive number of heads.
